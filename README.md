# SpeedEvaluation

GOAL

Test how much of a performance difference
concatenating strings is vs. using StringBuilder.
Append the same string in each case. Test at500,
5,000, and 50,000 iterations.

BONUS

Make a test harness that accepts an Action method.
Use it to test strings like in above and then also to test
the performance of decimal vs. double (0.5 million
and 5 million).
